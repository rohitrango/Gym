"""Pytest fixtures and skip markers for the gym_v resources server tests.

The helper-level tests under this directory only need pydantic + Pillow + the
nemo_gym schemas. The integration tests additionally need `gym_v` (and, for
some envs, `reasoning_gym`). Until the resources-server container image
pip-installs those extras, the integration tests must skip cleanly. The
markers exported here are the single source of truth for that.

Note on the top-level package-name collision (deliberate non-`__init__`).
========================================================================

The resources-server package is mounted at `resources_servers/gym_v/`. If
this tests directory also had an `__init__.py`, pytest's default conftest
discovery would walk upward to the first non-`__init__` ancestor and prepend
that ancestor (`…/resources_servers/`) to `sys.path`, which would then make
a bare `import gym_v` resolve to OUR local package instead of the upstream
pip-installed Gym-V. We deliberately leave this directory without an
`__init__.py` and rely on pytest's rootdir-based discovery, exactly like the
neighbouring aviary server does.
